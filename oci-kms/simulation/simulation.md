This lab assumes you have:
* An Oracle Cloud account
* All previous labs successfully completed


## Task 1: Load sample data into your Autonomous Database 

In this task you will load data into your previously created Autonomous Database and also in your bucket.

1. Right-click on the link below and click **Save Link Asâ€¦** to download the file to your computer.

	TODO: link

2. Navigate to your Autonomous Database page in OCI console and go to the Data Load main page by going to the Database Actions Launchpad and in the **Data Studio** section, click **DATA LOAD.**

5. When the upload is complete, you simply click the blue **Start** button and click **Run** to run the data load job.

6. When the load job finishes, a green check mark appears for each table. Click **Catalog** in the menu on the left.
